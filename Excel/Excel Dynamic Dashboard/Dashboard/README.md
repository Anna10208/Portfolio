üìä Excel Dynamic Dashboard ‚Äî Charity Donations Analysis




üéØ Purpose

The presented dashboard was developed as part of a comprehensive Excel-based reporting system for analyzing donation inflows to a charitable foundation. The main goals were:

-	Visualize donation data dynamically over a 2-year period
-	Provide leadership and stakeholders with a clear and interactive overview
-	Enable flexible filtering and comparison across timeframes and donor dimensions



‚ö†Ô∏è All visible figures and personal data have been anonymized or altered to comply with confidentiality requirements. Due to the sensitive nature of the real dataset, publishing a fully functional version of the file is not feasible.

 
This project demonstrates Excel‚Äôs capability to serve as a powerful, user-friendly BI tool, offering interactivity, clean design, and actionable insights ‚Äî even without external plugins or Power BI.

-	9 slicers for real-time interactivity
-	Bar charts (vertical & horizontal), pie charts, and summary cards
