# Excel Project: Automated ORDER for Payment Form


This project showcases a custom-designed Excel-based payment request form used within a company's official financial workflow. 

üéØThe form was created to streamline the internal process of submitting payment requests to the accounting department and ensure budget classification accuracy.


üß© Business Context
Previously, employees submitted payment forms manually, often omitting required fields or making errors in budget classification (article, section, sub-section). This created bottlenecks and extra work for accounting and approvers. The new Excel form was developed as a structured and semi-automated solution to improve data accuracy and reduce manual input.


‚öôÔ∏è Impact

-	Significant reduction in submission errors
-	Faster processing by accounting and budget control teams
-	Streamlined internal workflow prior to transition to electronic document management systems
Note: All data in the sample file has been anonymized or modified to comply with confidentiality requirements.  


üìÅ File Contents

-	ORDER_for_payment.xlsx ‚Äì fully functional template
-	Sheet 1: Blank dynamic form
-	Sheet 2: Completed example for guidance



‚úÖ Key Features

-	Dropdown Menus with Dynamic Filtering
    - Budget article, section, and sub-section fields are selected from dropdowns. Once a budget section is chosen, only valid articles related to that section are available, reducing user error.

-	Auto-Filled Fields (Highlighted in Blue)
    - Amount in words ‚Äî automatically generated from the numeric value using a custom formula, aligned with legal requirements
    - Filler's phone number ‚Äî auto-filled from user profile or linked cell
    -	Submission date ‚Äî auto-filled upon opening or editing
    -	KBK (Budget Classification Code) ‚Äî retrieved based on selected article for downstream automation
-	Built-In Approval Flow
    - The form requires preliminary approval from one of three authorized managers before submission to accounting.
-	Sample Sheet for User Guidance
    - A second worksheet provides a fully filled-out example of the form to help employees fill it correctly.
 

This project demonstrates Excel as a powerful tool not only for calculations, but also for process design, automation, and internal control.
